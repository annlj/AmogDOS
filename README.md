# AmogDOS
Minimal Debian-based boot image for Calamares installer in AmogOS

AmogDOS is a very tiny heavily-modified Debian image containing IceWM, essestial linux commands, and the Calamares installer to install AmogOS. Think of it like Windows PE.

AmogDOS is being developed by @HVilaverde for the AmogOS project.
